# Issue Triage Guidelines

> **Note**: The software and documentation are provided in English only.

This guide explains how maintainers should handle new GitHub issues.

## 1. Review Schedule
* Check the issue tracker once per week.
* Apply the `bug` or `enhancement` label based on the report.

## 2. Duplicates and Clarification
* Search for existing issues before triaging.
* Ask for additional logs or reproduction steps if needed.

## 3. Prioritisation
* Tag high impact problems with `priority/high`.
* Minor requests receive `priority/low`.

## 4. Closing Issues
* Close resolved issues with a short explanation and reference the commit or pull request.
* If no response is received after 30 days, close as `stale`.

Community contributions are encouraged. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow details.
