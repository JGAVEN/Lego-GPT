# Community Examples

The front-end loads sample prompts from `frontend/public/examples.json`. Each entry has an `id`, `title`, `prompt`, and `image` URL. Contributions are welcome. To add a new example:

1. Add an object to `examples.json` with a unique `id`.
2. Use a square image around 200Ã—150 pixels hosted on a stable URL.
3. Submit a pull request describing your build.

Examples are curated for variety and clarity. Screenshots generated with Lego GPT are preferred.
